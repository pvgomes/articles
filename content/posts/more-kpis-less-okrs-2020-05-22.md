After years working on startups I feel comfortable to affirm(establish or strengthen as with new evidence or facts) that we must keep focused on KPI's more than into OKR's!

But wait a minute, why am I saying that? I mean, KPI and OKR are different right? They walk together if you have a good defined KPI's you can set your company or team ORK's based on data, but sometimes we focus only on our OKR's and we don't know anything about our KPI's and its trick, cause sometimes is also difficult to measure the percentage of possibilities to reach our goals. But no worries, it happens because we're in some context that is "impossible" to have our own metrics, it is most common in horizontal teams, like back-office platform. But I was wondering if is 100% true, should we look at AARRR metrics? It looks like make no sense for some cases don't you think? Perhaps we should think about the meaning behind the metrics, we can force ourselves to look around our context and find our own metrics.

data bring to us insights to act
Imagine some Google, Microsoft, or AWS platform team, do you think that they work without KPI's? I don't know to be honest, but it looks like they have one, and keep working to find what makes sense for them in a defined context cause its necessary to have insights and then merge with your goals concerns.

Let's imagine the following scenario, I work on a platform(horizontal team) which are responsible to connect services, for our clients doesn't matter how we'll connect their services to another, they just need to know that we'll do it without any problems, in this case, perhaps our metrics could be "connection failure rate" and with this, as our simple tech metric we can research more about what should be good to work around this, like "how difficult is to use our services"? How can you know? We can take a look at the rate time where teams get to connect and with this we can see if we have a problem to solve.

My message here is more simple than you think, I just want to say that everything could be measured and with this, we can set more effective goals and than just after that work on our OKR's
