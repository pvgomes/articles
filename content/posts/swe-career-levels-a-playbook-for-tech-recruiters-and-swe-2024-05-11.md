Nowadays in the tech industry we have a lot of roles and responsibilities but still one of the most important are, in fact, software engineering. The journey from a new software engineer to a distinguished software engineer is a path full of challenges, growth, and continuous learning. Understanding the various levels and the skills required at each stage can provide clarity and direction for aspiring software engineers. After 15 years working in the industry I decided to create this guide where we’ll explore the different levels of software engineering roles, from **Associate Software Engineer** to **Distinguished Software Engineer**, along with their scopes, technical skill requirements, soft skills, and some key takeaways that define their levels, always considering that measure humans roles is ok while measuring humans by itself is impossible and not a science but, a guess.

Be aware that the names sometimes are not that perfect/equal in the industry, but for each level I’ll give you some “level synonyms” that might help you to get the most usage variations in the industry. I also did some research around the big techs to see how they are doing nowadays. I will also focus only on individual contributors, meaning that in this article I will not cover the manager role.

# 1\. Associate Software Engineer

The Associate Software Engineer is the beginning of a software engineer’s journey. At this level, individuals typically have a foundational understanding of programming languages and basic software development concepts. Responsibilities may include writing code, debugging, and assisting more experienced team members. They usually need a defined task/feature/card to work on meaning that they can participate in planning but are not expected to make a deep contribution during this phase of the projects.

**Scope**: Associates often work on smaller components of projects under the guidance of senior engineers. They contribute to the overall development process but may not yet have ownership of entire features or projects.

**Technical Skills**: Proficiency in one or more programming languages such as Python, Java, JavaScript, PHP, Go, Kotlin, etc., is essential. Familiarity with version control systems like Git and a basic understanding of software development methodologies are also necessary. Additionally, understanding the distinctions between frontend and backend development, as well as knowledge of databases and their integration in real-world applications, is crucial. Basic proficiency in Bash scripting and familiarity with terminal usage are often required. Furthermore, having an overall understanding of at least one cloud provider such as AWS, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud is typically expected.

**Soft Skills**: Communication skills but on the asking questions usage, ability to collaborate effectively in a team environment, eagerness to learn and adapt to new technologies.

**Synonyms**: Junior Software Engineer, E3, Software Engineer I, Engineer I, Junior Engineer
