**Conway’s Law**, introduced by computer scientist Melvin Conway in 1968, states:  
_“Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization’s communication structure.”_

This observation implies that the architecture of a software system will inherently reflect the communication patterns of the teams that develop it. While Conway’s Law provides insight into the relationship between organizational structure and system design, it can have significant negative effects on software engineering if not managed properly.

# How Conway’s Law Can Negatively Impact Software Engineering Teams

1. 1.  **Fragmented Systems Reflect Team Silos**  
1.     When teams are structured around specific functions (e.g., frontend, backend, QA), their communication boundaries often create systems with poor integration. This can lead to overly complex architectures, such as tightly coupled components that are hard to scale or maintain.
1. 2.  Example: A team responsible for APIs may build services optimized for their goals, while the frontend team struggles to use those APIs effectively due to mismatched requirements.
1. 3.  **Reduced Collaboration and Innovation**  
1.     Communication gaps between teams often result in misaligned goals. This leads to technical debt, duplicated efforts, and missed opportunities for innovation, as teams focus on isolated objectives rather than holistic outcomes.
1. 4.  **Difficulty Scaling**  
1.     As organizations grow, rigid team structures often exacerbate the challenges of scaling software. Misaligned teams may create software components that work well independently but fail under the stress of integration.
1. 5.  **Suboptimal User Experience**  
1.     When teams are organized based on internal considerations rather than user needs, the resulting product often fails to deliver a seamless user experience. For instance, a customer-facing app might feel disjointed because the teams responsible for different features don’t communicate effectively.

# Why Define the Software Platform First

Instead of organizing teams first and letting Conway’s Law dictate system design, a better approach is to define the software platform and architecture first. Then, structure teams to align with the system’s goals and user needs.

# Benefits of This Approach

1. 1.  **User-Centric Design**  
1.     By prioritizing the platform’s architecture, organizations ensure the system meets user needs. Teams can then be aligned around specific user journeys or services, leading to cohesive and optimized user experiences.
1. 2.  **Improved Modularity**  
1.     A platform-first approach encourages a modular architecture (e.g., microservices), which is easier to scale and maintain. Teams can then be structured to own distinct modules, reducing dependencies and promoting autonomy.
1. 3.  **Cross-Functional Collaboration**  
1.     Defining the software system first often highlights the need for cross-functional teams, where members with diverse skills collaborate to own end-to-end delivery. This minimizes communication bottlenecks and fosters innovation.
1. 4.  **Flexibility and Scalability**  
1.     Teams organized around a well-defined system architecture are better equipped to adapt as the platform evolves. This agility is critical in dynamic industries where software requirements change frequently.

# Examples and References

# Spotify Model

Spotify structures its teams into “squads” that own specific user-facing or system-level functionalities. This organizational approach supports their modular platform architecture, enabling faster feature development and scaling.

# Industry Case Study

The failure of monolithic systems like the [healthcare.gov](http://healthcare.gov/) rollout in the U.S. highlights how mismatched team structures can hinder project success. Conversely, companies like Amazon organize teams around their microservices platform, ensuring high autonomy and efficiency.

# Conclusion

Conway’s Law reveals the inherent connection between organizational structure and software architecture. To mitigate its negative effects, companies should prioritize designing their software platform before defining their team structure. This ensures the system reflects user needs rather than internal silos, fostering innovation, scalability, and better collaboration.
