# pvgomes Articles

This repository contains a backup of my Medium articles in Markdown format.  
It is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with the [PaperMod](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-papermod/) theme.

## ðŸ“š Purpose

I use this repository to:
- Keep a version-controlled backup of all my published content
- Generate a simple, clean blog-style website
- Future-proof my articles in case Medium is no longer available

## ðŸš€ Local Development

To run this site locally:

```bash
hugo server
```

Then visit: http://localhost:1313

Create new article

```
 hugo new posts/NEW-article.md 
 ```
